# aquis_boards
Arduino definition files for the SpaceTeamAachen Aquis microcontrollers.

## package_aquis_index.json
I added a workaround because the internal package_index.json that is shipped with the Arduino IDE uses an out-of-date version of the openocd tool. You can see it under the "tools" section. It just uses the up-to-date version of the one used by the Adafruit SAMD package index.
